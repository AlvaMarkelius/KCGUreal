				<h2>What is KCGU?</h2>
				<p>The King’s College Graduate Union (KCGU) is the Student Union for graduate students at King’s College. 
					KCGU operates in law as an unincorporated charity and student union. Charities have to have certain objectives that they work to fulfil. 
					Everything we do has to be in pursuit of these objectives. For KCGU these are:</p>
					
					<ul>
					  <li>To be the official representative body, and student union, of graduate students at the College.</li>
					  <li>To operate fairly, democratically, transparently.</li>
					  <li>To operate in such a way that facilitates the smooth transition between KCGU Committees and graduate student cohorts.</li>
					  <li>To foster and maintain a sense of community amongst graduate students. This includes, but is not limited to, the promotion of social, intellectual, and sporting interaction between members of KCGU.</li>
					  <li>To foster and maintain a sense of community amongst all college students. This includes working with King’s College Student Union to facilitate a harmonious relationship between graduate and undergraduate students. This shall be achieved through the promotion of social, intellectual, and sporting interaction between members of KCGU and KCSU.</li>
					  <li>To oppose and eliminate all prejudice and discrimination within College and the University.</li>
					  <li>To promote the interests of graduate students, and the wider student body of the College.</li>
					  <li>To ensure graduate students are properly represented on any College or University bodies that further the above objectives.</li>
					</ul>					

				<h2>What do KCGU do?</h2>
				<p>The KCGU Committee endeavour to uphold and further the aims outlined above. This might look like sitting on College-wide committees to represent KCGU, creating policy that helps KCGU function, and holding referenda to gain insights that enable us to better represent the membership of KCGU, among many other things. Another core aspect of KCGU is creating and facilitating a community-driven environment for the graduate student body. We organise events such as freshers, socials, themed formals, garden parties, cheese and wine nights, and more. Our Social Secretaries are always planning fun and interesting activities for the KCGU membership. In addition, we have dedicated officers that provide further representation, support, and act as points of contact between you and the College. Currently we have a Welfare Officer, LGBTQ+ Officer, Gender Equalities Officer, International Students Officer, Sports and Societies Officer, and Academic Affairs Officer. Ultimately, KCGU is here for you in all aspects of College life during your time at King’s.</p>
				<h2>Who is a Member of KCGU?</h2>

				<p>KCGU Members are anyone who:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Is a Graduate Student</li>
				<li>Was 21 at the beginning of the academic year</li>
				<li>Is a clinical medical or vet student</li>
				<li>Is an undergrad in their fourth year</li>
				<li>Is a visiting student</li>
				</ul>

				<p>There are also affiliate members. These members have all the same rights as members, but policy is allowed to limit their rights. Currently we give affiliate membership to:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Partners of members who register themselves with the Secretary.</li>
				<li>Those in-residence at King’s who are not members and register themselves with the Secretary.</li>
				<li>Any person who is endorsed for Affiliate Membership by the Executive Committee. Such Affiliate Membership shall last until the beginning of the next academic year.</li>
				<li>Any person who has been a member of KCGU and is elected to the Cambridge Student Union as a Sabbatical Officer. Such Affiliate Membership shall last until they leave office as a Sabbatical Officer.</li>
				<li>Trustees of KCGU who have completed their degree, so that they may fulfil their duties over the Long Vacation.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Finally, we have the category of <strong>Honorary Membership</strong>. This does not confer any rights (except as designated by policy) but is a nice way to recognise those who have acted in significant service to the Union or the graduate student body.</p>

				<h2>How do People Join the KCGU Committee?</h2>

				<p>Normally, people are elected. The Executive Committee is elected annually in a secret ballot. Elections happen at the beginning of Michaelmas Term, and must happen before Week 3.</p>

				<p>Sometimes people are appointed. Trustees can never be appointed, only elected, but everyone else can be. Appointments happen when Offices are left vacant after an election, or because a new Office is created in-between elections. It’s the President’s job to appoint people, but they need the agreement of the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee must vote with a quorum of five and a simple majority to confirm any appointments.</p>
